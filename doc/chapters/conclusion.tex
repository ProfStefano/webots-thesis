The main purpose of this work was to present the Webots simulator and to describe the state-of-the-art regarding robot localization techniques along with Bayesian filters and finally show some preliminar results.

The present work will be used next year for the master thesis in order to implement a more generic algorithm for robot localization using more advanced techniques under the Bayesian filters literature.
